# Todo list:
# DONE:
# 1. add blacklist feature that will not list activities if a word is included in the window name
#     ex. is Binance where the window name changes every second. This may cause the program to reach googles api limits
#         another ex is when I'm watching the tech tip üôÄ
# 6. Workaround for sites that change their page name e.g. messaging sites where notifications change window name, trading where price is displayed every sec
# 8. Handle Blacklisting and censoring in a file instead of in-program -DONE

# Inprogress:
# 7. Make the program invisible .pyw, logging... - In progress - logging DONE, headless mode not sensible atm
# 3. Better google sheets dashboard. might use google data studio.
#

# Queued:
# 9. End of day data saving
# 2. Better initialization - when the script is ran, save all the current spreadsheet data then clear it to make way for new data
