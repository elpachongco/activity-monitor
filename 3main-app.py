# Todo list:
#     1. add blacklist feature that will not list activities if a word is included in the window name
#             ex. is Binance where the window name changes every second. This may cause the program to reach googles api limits
#              another ex is when I'm watching the tech tip üôÄ
#     2. Better initialization - when the script is ran, save all the current spreadsheet data then clear it to make way for new data
#     3. Better google sheets dashboard. might use google data studio.
#     4. BUG#1 occurence of -1,617,418,605.75 and the positive equivalent, sometimes
#        - hypothesis: the bug is caused by the variable "activityMinTime" 
#     5. Auto program sleep if user is inactive for a set amount of time
