# Activity Dashboard  

This is the experimental dashboard for the activity database.

## Design plan 📝

This part contains the things I'm considering while designing the dashboard.

### My usage/activity - Wants

Without thinking about the implementation, the things I want to know about
my usage/activity are:

- Statistics about me, today
    - My performance today vs my usual (avg?) performance
    - Current day start time vs my usual start time
    - Inactivity vs activity ratio today ✅

- Stats about me, long-term
    - My most active hours in a day ✅
    - My most active days of the week  ✅
    - My average day duration
    - Total activity duration per day in a week ✅
    - 10-day activity vs inactivity ✅
    - Ratio of activity and inactivity per day in the last x days 
    - calendar view of 1-year daily activity duration.
